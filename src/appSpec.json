        "designSummary": "**The Electric Gradient: A Fusion of Tech and Healing**\n\nThe Vision: Venicura's brand is built on the promise of modern, efficient healthcare. This design translates that promise into a sleek, futuristic aesthetic. The core concept is the 'Electric Gradient,' where healing green merges seamlessly with electric blue, creating a sense of technological advancement and well-being. The layout is dynamic, with subtle asymmetry and layered elements that evoke a sense of depth and innovation.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Gradient as a Guiding Light: The electric blue to healing green gradient is the primary brand identifier. It will be used subtly in backgrounds, button highlights, and as an overlay on images.\n2. Asymmetrical Balance: The layout will avoid perfect symmetry, using slightly offset elements and diagonal lines to create visual interest and a sense of forward motion.\n3. Glassmorphism for Depth: Card-based components will utilize a 'glassmorphism' effect (frosted glass) to create a layered, modern feel.\n4. Micro-Animations for Engagement: Subtle animations (fade-ins, slide-ups, hover effects) will be used to guide the user and add a touch of interactivity without being distracting.",
